# A Step-by-Step Guide to Get Out of AI Hype (book)
## The Executive's Framework for Making Smart Technology Investments

Every month, executives spend millions on AI initiatives that violate basic business principles they would never ignore in any other context. IBM's $5 billion Watson failure. Zillow's $304 million algorithmic loss. Klarna's CEO admitting their AI-first strategy "resulted in lower quality work." These aren't isolated mistakes—they're predictable outcomes from confusing technological sophistication with business value.
This book cuts through the AI hype to provide executives with practical frameworks for making smart technology investments. Based on comprehensive research tracking major AI implementations from January to July 2025, it reveals why 73% of AI timeline promises failed, why only 25% of AI initiatives deliver expected ROI, and why the companies succeeding aren't those with the biggest budgets or most advanced models—they're those applying fundamental business discipline with unusual rigor.

## What You'll Learn:
The Universal Laws of AI Investment - Just as thermodynamics determines which physical processes can occur, ROI > 1 determines which AI implementations succeed. Learn to apply this fundamental filter to cut through vendor complexity and focus on measurable business outcomes.
Why Smart Companies Miss AI Deadlines - Microsoft's consumer AI captured 0.5% market share while their enterprise GitHub Copilot grew 10x. Apple delayed advanced Siri 15+ months. Amazon's consumer Alexa+ disappointed while Q Developer exceeded benchmarks. Discover the systematic patterns separating success from failure.
The Psychology of AI Over-Promising - Complexity bias, anthropomorphism effects, and authority bias combine to make smart executives vulnerable to AI vendor manipulation. Understand these psychological traps and build systematic defenses against them.
Executive Decision-Making Frameworks - The three-question protocol that prevents expensive mistakes. The 48-hour rule that counters vendor pressure tactics. Systematic pilot processes designed to find failure modes before they become costly disasters.
Future-Proof Strategic Planning - Build decision-making capability that remains valuable whether AI development accelerates, stagnates, or follows unexpected directions. Focus on organizational learning capacity rather than technology predictions.
Real Executive Testimonials - Sebastian Siemiatkowski's Klarna reversal. Jamie Dimon's $1 billion JPMorgan success. Doug McMillon's systematic Walmart approach. Paul Hlivko's "enterprise time" insights. Learn from leaders who've navigated both AI successes and failures.
Practical Implementation Tools - Organizational learning capacity assessment tables. ROI calculation frameworks. Red team assignment protocols. Systematic vendor evaluation checklists you can use immediately.
